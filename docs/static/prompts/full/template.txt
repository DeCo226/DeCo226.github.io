# Robotic Arm Task Goal

The robotic arm interacts with the environment and objects to execute tasks by adhering to a series of instructions. The goal is to accurately interpret these instructions and perform the required actions efficiently to complete the given task.

# User Goal Description

Generate optimized step-by-step commands for the robotic arm to complete tasks as described by high-level input. Each step must follow the predefined skillset, eliminate redundant actions, and be formatted for direct execution.

# Task Decomposition Requirements and Principles

1. Break down high-level instructions into sequential steps using predefined skills.
2. Actions must align with the environment's current state.

# Output Format and Rules

1. **Output Format**:
    - **Atomic-Level Commands**: A numbered list of instructions written in lowercase without punctuation, where each step corresponds to one predefined skill.
2. **Rules**:
    - Instructions must be logically ordered, optimized for efficiency, and minimal in number.
